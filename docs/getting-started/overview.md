# Overview

## What is KrakenHashes?

KrakenHashes is a distributed password cracking management system that transforms the power of Hashcat into an enterprise-ready platform. While Hashcat excels as a command-line tool for password recovery, KrakenHashes adds the orchestration, management, and collaboration features needed for professional security teams.

Think of KrakenHashes as the control center for your password auditing operations – coordinating multiple machines, managing vast collections of hashes, and providing actionable insights through an intuitive web interface.

## Why KrakenHashes?

### The Challenge with Direct Hashcat Usage

Running Hashcat directly presents several challenges for security teams:

- **Single Machine Limitation**: Hashcat runs on one machine at a time
- **Manual Coordination**: No built-in way to distribute work across multiple systems
- **Limited Visibility**: Command-line output makes it hard to track multiple jobs
- **No Collaboration**: Difficult for teams to share resources and results
- **Manual Management**: Wordlists, rules, and results require manual organization

### The KrakenHashes Solution

KrakenHashes addresses these limitations by providing:

- **Distributed Processing**: Coordinate multiple agents across your infrastructure
- **Centralized Management**: Single interface for all your cracking operations
- **Team Collaboration**: Share resources, results, and strategies
- **Automated Workflows**: Pre-configured attack patterns and job templates
- **Enterprise Features**: Authentication, authorization, and audit trails

## Key Features and Capabilities

## Workflows: Attack Strategy Made Simple

One of KrakenHashes' most powerful features is the workflow system. Instead of manually running different Hashcat commands, you can define comprehensive attack strategies:

### Example: Standard Password Audit Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Quick Wins] -->|Found: 40%| B[Common Passwords]
    B -->|Found: 15%| C[Rule-Based Attacks]
    C -->|Found: 20%| D[Hybrid Attacks]
    D -->|Found: 10%| E[Brute Force]
    
    style A fill:#90EE90
    style B fill:#87CEEB
    style C fill:#FFB6C1
    style D fill:#FFE4B5
    style E fill:#F0E68C
```

1. **Quick Wins** - Try the most common passwords first
2. **Common Passwords** - Test against known breach compilations
3. **Rule-Based** - Apply transformations to wordlists
4. **Hybrid Attacks** - Combine wordlists with masks
5. **Brute Force** - Last resort for remaining hashes

## Security Considerations

### 🛡️ Data Protection

- Role-based permissions (Admin/User)
- Secure session management with token validation

### 📝 Compliance

- Comprehensive audit logging
- Data retention policies
- Client data isolation
- Export capabilities for reporting

### ⚠️ Operational Security
