## Understanding Analytics Sections

### Overview Statistics

The **Overview** section provides high-level metrics:

- **Total Hashes**: Number of hashes analyzed
- **Total Cracked**: Number of successfully cracked passwords
- **Crack Rate**: Percentage of hashes cracked
- **Hash Mode Breakdown**: Distribution of hash types (NTLM, NetNTLMv2, etc.)

**Use Case**: Executive summary statistics for client reports

### Domain-Based Filtering ðŸ†•

**New in v1.2+**: Analytics reports now support domain-based filtering for multi-domain environments.

#### How It Works

When your analyzed hashlists contain hashes with domain information (e.g., NetNTLMv2, NTLM pwdump, Kerberos), the system:

1. **Automatically extracts domains** from hash formats
2. **Creates dynamic tabs** at the top of the Overview section:
   - **"All" tab**: Shows aggregated statistics across all domains
   - **Domain tabs**: One tab per unique domain found (e.g., `acme.local`, `example.com`)
3. **Filters all analytics sections** when a domain is selected

#### Domain Breakdown Table

When the **"All" tab** is selected, a domain breakdown table appears showing:

| Domain | Total Hashes | Cracked | Percentage |
|--------|--------------|---------|------------|
| acme.local | 14,638 | 14,638 | 100.00% |
| contoso.local | 14,638 | 14,638 | 100.00% |
| example.com | 14,638 | 14,638 | 100.00% |

#### Filtering by Domain

**To filter analytics by domain:**

1. Click a domain tab (e.g., `acme.local`)
2. All sections automatically update to show only that domain's data:
   - Overview statistics show only the domain's hashes
   - Hash Mode Breakdown shows only hash types present in that domain
   - All other sections (Length, Complexity, etc.) filter accordingly
3. Click **"All"** to return to aggregated view

#### Use Cases for Domain Filtering

**Multi-Domain Active Directory Environments:**
```
Scenario: Client has acquired multiple companies, each with their own AD domain
Use Domain Filtering to:
- Compare password security between legacy vs. new domains
- Identify which organizational units need security training
- Report on password patterns specific to each business unit
```

**Department/Location Analysis:**
```
Scenario: Large organization with geographic domains (us.corp.com, eu.corp.com, apac.corp.com)
Use Domain Filtering to:
- Compare regional password practices
- Identify location-specific security issues
- Target training to specific regions
```

**Client Reporting:**
```
Scenario: Security assessment covering multiple subsidiaries
Use Domain Filtering to:
- Generate per-subsidiary security reports
- Show executives domain-specific vulnerabilities
- Provide targeted recommendations per organizational unit
```

### Length Distribution

Analyzes password lengths to identify patterns:

- **Distribution Chart**: Visual representation of password lengths
- **Average Length**: Mean password length across cracked passwords
- **Most Common Length**: Mode of the distribution
- **Length Range**: Minimum and maximum password lengths

**Key Metrics:**
- Percentage of passwords under 8 characters
- Percentage meeting typical complexity requirements (12+ characters)
- Distribution curve shape (indicates policy enforcement)

**Example Findings:**
- "78% of passwords are exactly 8 characters, indicating a minimum-length-only policy"
- "No passwords exceed 12 characters, suggesting users choose minimum-required lengths"

### Complexity Analysis

Evaluates password composition and character usage:

- **Character Class Usage**:
  - Lowercase only
  - Uppercase only
  - Numbers only
  - Mixed alphanumeric
  - Special characters

- **Complexity Metrics**:
  - Percentage meeting corporate policies
  - Common character substitutions (e.g., `@` for `a`, `3` for `e`)
  - Entropy calculations

**Example Findings:**
- "45% of passwords use only lowercase letters"
- "92% of passwords with special characters use `!` as the final character"

### Positional Analysis

Examines where different character types appear in passwords:

- **First Character Analysis**: Common starting characters (capital letters, digits)
- **Last Character Analysis**: Common ending patterns (special chars, digits, years)
- **Middle Patterns**: Character placement in password body

**Example Findings:**
- "67% of passwords start with an uppercase letter (indicates capital-first policy)"
- "84% of passwords end with a digit or exclamation point"
- "Year patterns (2023, 2024) commonly appear at password end"

### Pattern Detection

Identifies common password patterns and structures:

- **Keyboard Patterns**: `qwerty`, `asdf`, `12345`
- **Common Sequences**: `abc123`, `password1`
- **Name + Number**: `John2024`, `Alice123`
- **Base Word + Modification**: `Password!`, `Welcome1`

**Pattern Categories:**
- Dictionary words
- Keyboard walks
- Repeating characters
- Sequential characters
- Common substitutions

**Example Findings:**
- "234 passwords follow the pattern [Name][Year]"
- "156 passwords use keyboard walks (qwerty, asdfgh)"

### Username Correlation

Analyzes relationships between usernames and passwords:

- **Username in Password**: Passwords containing the username
- **Partial Username Match**: Password contains part of username
- **Name-Based Passwords**: FirstName/LastName in password
- **Common Variations**: Username + season/year

**Example Findings:**
- "23% of passwords contain the user's first or last name"
- "89 users have password that equals their username"

### Password Reuse

Identifies password reuse across accounts:

- **Reuse Count**: Number of accounts sharing the same password
- **Most Reused Passwords**: Top passwords by usage count
- **Reuse Percentage**: Percentage of users with non-unique passwords

**Example Findings:**
- "The password 'Welcome123' is used by 45 different accounts"
- "34% of all accounts share passwords with at least one other account"

### Temporal Patterns

Examines time-based patterns in passwords:

- **Season References**: `Summer2024`, `Winter23`
- **Month Names**: `January`, `March2024`
- **Year Patterns**: Current year, previous years
- **Date Formats**: `01012024`, `2024-01-01`

**Example Findings:**
- "78% of passwords containing years use the current year (2024)"
- "Seasonal passwords most commonly reference 'Summer' and 'Fall'"

### Mask Analysis

Shows password structure patterns using hashcat mask format:

- **Top Masks**: Most common password structures
- **Mask Distribution**: Frequency of each pattern
- **Complexity by Mask**: Strength assessment per structure

**Mask Format:**
- `?l` = lowercase letter
- `?u` = uppercase letter
- `?d` = digit
- `?s` = special character

**Example Masks:**
```
?u?l?l?l?l?l?l?d    = Capital + 6 lowercase + 1 digit (Welcome1)
?u?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?d?d = Capital + 7 lowercase + 2 digits (Password24)
```

**Example Findings:**
- "Most common mask: ?u?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?d (43% of passwords)"
- "Top 5 masks account for 87% of all cracked passwords"

### Custom Patterns

Track organization-specific password patterns:

- **Company Name Usage**: Passwords containing company name
- **Product Names**: References to company products/services

### Domain Extraction Process

Domains are automatically extracted during hashlist upload:

**Supported Hash Formats:**
- **NetNTLMv2 (5600)**: `username::domain:challenge:response`
- **NTLM pwdump (1000)**: `DOMAIN\username:sid:lm:nt:::`
- **Kerberos (18200)**: `$krb5asrep$23$user@domain.com:hash`

**Extraction Details:**
- Domains stored in `hashes.domain` column
- Indexed for fast filtering
- See [Username Extraction Architecture](../reference/architecture/username-extraction.md) for full details

### Database Schema

Analytics reports are stored in the `analytics_reports` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE analytics_reports (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id),
    name VARCHAR(255),
    hashlist_ids INTEGER[],
    analytics_data JSONB,
    total_hashlists INTEGER,
    total_hashes INTEGER,
    total_cracked INTEGER,
    crack_percentage NUMERIC,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

**Analytics Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "overview": {...},
  "length_distribution": {...},
  "complexity_analysis": {...},
  "domain_analytics": [
    {
      "domain": "acme.local",
      "overview": {...},
      "length_distribution": {...},
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Report Generation Issues

**Problem**: Report generation fails or times out

**Solutions**:
- Ensure all selected hashlists are in "ready" status
- Try generating with fewer hashlists
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify database connectivity

**Problem**: Domain tabs don't appear

**Causes**:
- No hashes in the hashlists contain domain information
- Only hash types without domain support (e.g., MD5, SHA1, bcrypt)
- Domains weren't extracted during upload

**Solutions**:
- Verify hash format supports domains (NetNTLMv2, NTLM, Kerberos)
- Check if `domain` column is populated for hashes
- Re-upload hashlist to trigger domain extraction

### Data Accuracy Issues

**Problem**: Analytics don't match expected values

**Checks**:
- Verify correct hashlists are selected
- Check if potfile was imported from external source
- Ensure time range filter is appropriate
- Verify no hashes were manually modified

## Best Practices

### Generating Meaningful Reports

1. **Select Appropriate Scope**: Include only relevant hashlists for the analysis
2. **Use Domain Filtering**: Leverage domain separation for multi-domain environments
3. **Document Context**: Note any custom patterns defined before generation
4. **Regular Cadence**: Generate reports periodically to track improvements
5. **Combine with POT Data**: Cross-reference with raw POT exports for detailed analysis

### Security and Privacy

1. **Access Control**: Restrict report access to authorized personnel
2. **Data Retention**: Delete old reports per data retention policies
3. **Anonymization**: Remove identifying information from client-facing reports
4. **Secure Export**: Encrypt exported analytics data
5. **Audit Trail**: Track who generates and views reports

### Performance Optimization

1. **Hashlist Selection**: Don't include unnecessary hashlists
2. **Archival**: Archive old reports that are no longer needed
3. **Storage Monitoring**: Monitor database growth from analytics data
4. **Cleanup**: Implement retention policies for old analytics reports
